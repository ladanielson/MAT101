<h1>MAT-101: Set 3A-Interpreting Graphs</h1>


<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Identify the quadrants and coordinates of \((x,y)\) points in the Cartesian coordinate plane. </li>
  <li>Identify coordinates of solutions to linear equations.</li>
  <li>Identify \(x\) and \(y\)-intercepts graphically and algebraically.</li>
</ul>

<H2>The Cartesian Coordinate Plane</H2>

<p>Often, to get an idea of the behavior of an equation we will make a picture that
represents the solutions to the equations. A graph is simply a picture of the solutions
to an equation. Before we spend much time on making a visual representation
of an equation, we first have to understand the basis of graphing. Following
is an example of what is called the Cartesian coordinate plane (named in honor of the
17th century philosopher, mathematician and scientist, Ren&eacute Descartes).</p>

<p><table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="set3A_Interpreting_Graphs_Grid.png"></td>
    <td>The plane is divided into four regions, called <b>quadrants</b>, by a horizontal number line (\(x\)-axis)
and a vertical number line (\(y\)-axis). </br>
 The quadrants are labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 and proceed counterclockwise around the plane as shown in the graph at the left.</br>
 Where the two lines meet in the center
is called the <b>origin</b>, marked by the green point. This center origin
is where \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\). </td>

  </tr>

</table></p>

<p>As we move
to the right of the origin the numbers count up
from zero, representing \(x=1, 2, 3\dots\).  To the left the numbers count down from zero, representing \(x = - 1, - 2, - 3\dots\).
Similarly, as we move up from the origin the number count up from zero, \(y = 1, 2, 3\dots\), and as we
move down count down from zero, \(y = -1, -2, -3, \dots\). We can put dots on the
graph which we will call points. Each point has an "address" that defines its location.
The first number will be the value on the \(x\)-axis or horizontal number line.
This is the distance the point moves left/right from the origin. The second
number will represent the value on the \(y\)-axis or vertical number line. This is
the distance the point moves up/down from the origin. The points are given as an
ordered pair \((x, y)\).</p>


<p>The following example finds the address or coordinate pair for each of several
points on the coordinate plane.</p>


<h3>Example 3A-1: Identify Quadrants and Coordinates</h3>
Give the quadrant and coordinates of each point.

<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set3A_Interpreting_Graphs_Ex_01.png"></td>
    <td>Notice that point A is in Q1 and point B is in Q2.  Point C is not in a quadrant but is on the \(y\)-axis.  </br></br>
    Tracing from the origin, point \(A\) is
right 1, up 4. This becomes \(A(1, 4)\).
Point \(B\) is left 5, up 3. Left is backwards
or negative so we have \(B( - 5, 3)\). \(C\) is straight down 2 units. There
is no left or right. This means we go
right zero so the point is \(C(0,-2)\).</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">\(A(1, 4)\text{ is in Q1},B(-5, 3)\text{ is in Q2}\),</br>
     and \(C(0,-2)\) is on the \(y\)-axis</td>
    <td>Our Solution <div class="WWbox">
                     Points in the plane are entered as <b>(#,#)=</br>
                     (horizontal #, vertical #)=(independent, dependent)</b> in <tt>WeBWorK</tt>.
                     </div>
</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>Just as we can give the coordinates for a set of points, we can take a set of points and plot them on the plane.</p>

<h3>Example 3A-2: Graph Points</h3>
Graph the points \(A(3, 2), B( - 2, 1), C(3, - 4), D( - 2, - 3), E( - 3, 0), F (0, 2),
G(0, 0)\)
<!-- Cite Beginning and Intermediate Algebra by Tyler Wallace Example 120 pg 90-->
<table>
 <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set3A_Interpreting_Graphs_Ex_02a.png"></td>
    <td>The first point, \(A\) is at \((3, 2)\).  This
means \(x=3\) (right 3) and \(y =2\) (up 2).
Following these instructions, starting
from the origin, we get our point. Note that \(A\) is in Q1.</br></br>
The second point, \(B( - 2, 1)\), is left 2
(negative moves backwards), up 1.
This is also illustrated on the graph. Note that \(B\) is in Q2.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set3A_Interpreting_Graphs_Ex_02b.png"></td>
    <td>The third point, \(C(3, - 4)\) is right 3,
down 4 (negative moves backwards).  Note that \(C\) is in Q4.</br></br>
The fourth point, \(D(-2, -3)\) is left
2, down 3 (both negative, both move
backwards). Note that \(D\) is in Q3.</td>

  </tr>
  </table>

 <p>The last three points have zeros in them. We still treat these points just like the
other points. If there is a zero there is just no movement.</p>

<center>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set3A_Interpreting_Graphs_Ex_02c.png"></td>
    <td>Next is \(E(-3, 0)\). This is left 3 (negative
is backwards), and up zero, right
on the \(x\)-axis.  Note that \(E\) is on the \(x\)-axis.</br></br>
Then is \(F(0, 2)\). This is right zero,
and up two, directly on the \(y\)-axis. Note that \(F\) is on the \(y\)-axis.</br></br>
Finally is \(G(0, 0)\). This point has no
movement. Thus the point is the origin.</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right"><img src="set3A_Interpreting_Graphs_Ex_02d.png"></td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The main purpose of graphs is not to plot random points, but rather to give a
picture of the solutions to an equation. We may have an equation such as \(y =
2x - 3\). To determine whether or not a point \((x,y)\) is a solution to a given equation, you substitute (or "plug in") the values into their corresponding variables in the equation and check to see that you get a true statement (both sides of the equation have equal values).</p>

<h3>Example 3A-3: Investigate Solution</h3>

<p>We may be interested in what type of solutions are possible with the equation \(y =
2x - 3\).  We can visualize the solution by making a graph of possible \(x\) and \(y\) combinations that make this equation a true statement. We will have to start by
finding possible \(x\) and \(y\) combinations. We will do this using a table of values.</p>

<h3>Example 3A-6: Graph a Given Equation</h3>
Graph \(y=2x-3\). We make a table of values.

<p>What this line tells us is that any point on the line will work in the equation \(y =
2x -3\). For example, notice the graph also goes through the point \((2, 1)\). If we use
\(x=2\), we should get \(y =1\). Sure enough, \(y =2(2)-3=4-3=1\), just as the graph
suggests. Thus we have a picture of all the solutions for \(y = 2x - 3\). We can use this table of values method to draw a graph of any linear equation.</p>

Notice that there are two points on the graph of the equation that lie on an axis.  One is the point in the table \((0,-2)\). It lies on the \(y\)-axis and is called a \(y\)-intercept. Another is the point \((3,0)\).  It lies on the \(x\)-axis and is called an \(x\)-intercept.

<p>
The intercepts are points on the graph where the graph crosses an axis.  If it is understood which kind of intercept is being referred to
we may slightly abuse the notation and say "The \(x\)-intercept is \(\dfrac{-2}{3}\)" instead of referring to the point \(\left( \dfrac{-2}{3},0\right)\).

<h3>Example 3A-11: Investigate Equation Relationships Graphically</h3>
Consider the graph of \(y=|x+1|\) in red together with the line \(y=3\) in blue below. For what values of \(x\) does \(|x+1|=3\)?

    <td align="right"><img src="set3A_Interpreting_Graphs_Ex_11.png"></td>
    <td>Using the graph, we see the red \(y=|x+1|\) and blue line \(y=3\) intersect at the two points \((-4,3)\) and \((2,3)\).</br></br>
    Thus, \(|x+1|=3\) at \(x=-4,2\).</td>

  <h3>Example 3A-12: Investigate Equation Relationships Graphically</h3>

    <td>Using the graph, we see the red \(y=|x+1|\) lies below the blue line \(y=3\) for \(x\) values between \(-4\) and \(2\).</br></br>
    Thus, \(|x+1|\lt 3\) for all \(x\) in the interval \((-4,2)\).</td>

 <h3>Example 3A-13: Investigate Equation Relationships Graphically</h3>
