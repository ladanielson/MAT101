    <title>Introduction</title>
    <p>
      <!--   This is CoconinoCC_chapter_4_Probability.pdf page 111 -->One story about how probability theory was developed is that a gambler wanted to know when to bet more and when to bet less. He talked to a couple of friends of his that happened to be mathematicians. Their names were Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal. Since then many other mathematicians have worked to develop probability theory.

    <p>Understanding probabilities are important in life. Examples of mundane questions that probability can answer for you are if you need to carry an umbrella or wear a heavy coat on a given day. More important questions that probability can help with are your chances that the car you are buying will need more maintenance, your chances of passing a class, your chances of winning the lottery, your chances of being in a car accident, and the chances that the U.S. will be attacked by terrorists. Most people do not have a very good understanding of probability, so they worry about being attacked by a terrorist but not about being in a car accident. The probability of being in a terrorist attack is much smaller than the probability of being in a car accident, thus it actually would make more sense to worry about driving. Also, the chance of you winning the lottery is very small, yet many people will spend the money on lottery tickets. Yet, if instead they saved the money that they spend on the lottery, they would have more money. In general, events that have a low probability (under
      <m>5\%</m>) are unlikely to occur. Whereas, if an event has a high probability of happening (over
      <m>80\%</m>), then there is a good chance that the event will happen. This chapter will present some of the theory that you need to help make a determination of whether an event is likely to happen or not.

    <title>Experiments and Sample Spaces</title>
    <p>First you need some definitions.
      <dl label="">
        <li>
          <title>Experiment</title>
          <p>An activity that has specific results that can occur, but it is unknown which results will occur.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Outcomes</title>
          <p>The results of an experiment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Event</title>
          <p>A set
            <m>A</m> of certain outcomes of an experiment that you want to have happen.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Sample Space</title>
          <p>collection of all possible outcomes of the experiment. Usually denoted as
            <m>SS</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Event space</title>
          <p>The set of outcomes that make up an event. The symbol is usually a capital letter.</p>
        </li>
      </dl>
    </p>
    <p>If all of the outcomes in a sample space are equally likely to happen, then the probability of an event
      <m>A</m> is calculated as follows.
    </p>
    <p>The
      <term>probability</term> of event
      <m>A</m> happening is
    </p>
    <mdn>
      <mrow>P(A) = \dfrac{\text{# of outcomes in event space
        <m>A</m>}}{\text{# of outcomes in sample space
        <m>SS</m>}}=\dfrac{n(A)}{n(SS)}
      </mrow>
    </mdn>
    <!--<p> If two coins are tossed, what is the probability that both coins will fall heads? The problem seems simple enough, but it is not uncommon to hear the incorrect answer <m>\dfrac{1}{3}</m>. A student may incorrectly reason that if two coins are tossed there are three possibilities, one head, two heads, or no heads. Therefore, the probability of two heads is one out of three. The answer is wrong because if we toss two coins there are <b>four</b> possibilities and not three. For clarity, assume that one coin is a penny and the other a nickel. Then we have the following four possibilities: </p> <p> HH HT TH TT </p> <p> The possibility HT, for example, indicates a head on the penny and a tail on the nickel, while TH represents a tail on the penny and a head on the nickel. </p> <p> It is for this reason, we emphasize the need for understanding sample spaces. </p> <p> An act of flipping coins, rolling dice, drawing cards, or surveying people are referred to as an <term>experiment</term>. </p> <p><b>Definition</b>: A <term>sample space, <m>S</m></term> of an experiment is the <u>set</u> of all possible outcomes. </p>-->
