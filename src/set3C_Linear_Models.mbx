    <title>Linear Models</title>
    <p>Now that you have an understanding of lines, we will consider linear models.  A
      <term>linear model</term> is an equation for a line that is connected to a real-world situation or data. What does this mean?
    </p>
    <p>Recall when we write the slope-intercept 
      <xref ref="equation-slope-intercept" autoname="yes" /> for a line:
    </p>
    <md>
      <mrow>y=mx+b</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>that
      <m>y</m> represents the
      <term>dependent variable</term> (sometimes called the
      <term>"response" variable</term>) and
      <m>x</m> represents the
      <term>independent variable</term> (sometimes called the
      <term>"predictor"</term>). Plugging in a particular value of
      <m>x</m> gives, or "predicts," a corresponding value for the response
      <m>y</m>. The value of the slope
      <m>m</m> of the line represents the estimated change in the response variable
      <m>y</m> for a one-unit change in the predictor variable
      <m>x</m>. Finally, the value of
      <m>b</m>(the
      <m>y</m>-intercept) is the value of the response
      <m>y</m> when the predictor
      <m>x</m> is zero. To summarize:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <m>y</m> is the
          <term>response</term> variable (it responds to changes in
          <m>x</m>)
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>x</m> is the
          <term>predictor</term> variable
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>m</m> represents the estimated change in the response
          <m>y</m> for a one-unit change in the predictor
          <m>x</m>
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>b</m> is the value of the response
          <m>y</m> when the predictor
          <m>x=0</m>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>Recall that points in the plane are denoted:

      <title>Road Trip! Determine Slope and Intercept of Given Model</title>
      <p>Suppose you are driving from Caldwell to LaGrande, OR to watch the Yotes play a game against Eastern Oregon University.  When you reach Ontario, OR (which is 30 miles into the drive) you are able to set your cruise control at 65 miles per hour (mph) for the remainder of the trip.  The linear equation
        <m>D=65t + 30</m> represents your distance from Caldwell
        <m>t</m> hours after turning on the cruise control.  Notice when
        <m>t=0</m>, your distance

         <p>First determine the slope.  Recall from <xref ref="section-3B-lines" autoname="yes" />, to determine the slope between
        <m>(100,47)</m> and
        <m>(259,63)</m> we first identify
        <m>n_1,C_1,n_2,C_2</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>(n_1,C_1)\amp =(100,47)\text{ and}</mrow>
        <mrow>(n_2,C_2)\amp =(259,63) \amp\amp\text{Use slope formula \(m=\dfrac{\text{change in cost}}{\text{change in copies}}=\dfrac{C_2-C_1}{n_2-n_1}\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>m\amp =\dfrac{63-47}{259-100}\amp\amp \text{Simplify}</mrow>
        <mrow>m\amp =\dfrac{16}{159}\amp\amp\text{(To avoid round-off error, don't convert to a decimal)}</mrow>
        <mrow>C\amp =\dfrac{16}{159}n+b\amp\amp\text{We have found the slope for the model}</mrow>
      </md>
      Choose one of the points to plug into the line.  We use <m>(100,47)=(n,C)</m>. Substitute the corresponding values in for
        <m>n=100</m> and
        <m>C=47</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>47\amp =\dfrac{16}{159}(100)+b\amp\amp\text{Simplify}</mrow>
          <mrow>47\amp =\dfrac{1600}{159}+b\amp\amp\text{Subtract \(\dfrac{1600}{159}\) from both sides}</mrow>
          <mrow>47-\dfrac{1600}{159}\amp =b\amp\amp\text{Approximate \(b\) on your calculator}</mrow>
          <mrow>b\amp\approx 36.9371\amp\amp\text{Write the model with the derived \(m\) and \(b\)}</mrow>
