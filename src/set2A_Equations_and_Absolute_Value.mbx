    <title>Linear Equations</title>
    <p>Solving linear equations is an important and fundamental skill in algebra. In algebra, we are often presented with a problem where the answer is known, but part of the problem is missing. The missing part of the problem is what we seek to find. An example of such a problem is shown below.
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
          \(4x + 16= -4\)}</mrow>
      </md>
    Notice the above problem has a missing part, or unknown, that is marked by
      <m>x</m>. If we are given that the solution to this equation is
      <m>-5</m>, it could be plugged into the equation, replacing the
      <m>x</m>with <m>-5</m>. This is shown below.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="demonstrate-solution">
      <title>A Solution</title>
      <p>Start with the equation
        <m>4x + 16= -4</m>. Let
        <m>x=-5</m>:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(4(-5) + 16\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Multiply
        \(4(-5)\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(-20+ 16\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Add
        \(-20+ 16\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(-4\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{
        \(-4=-4\): The left-hand side equals the right-hand side: LHS=RHS}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>Now the equation comes out to a true statement! Notice also that if another number, for example,
      <m>3</m>, were plugged in for
      <m>x</m>, we would not get a true statement.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="not-a-solution">
      <title>NOT a Solution</title>
      <p>Start with the equation
        <m>4x + 16= -4</m>. Let
        <m>x=3</m>:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(4(3) + 16\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Multiply
        \(4(3)\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(12+ 16\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Add
        \(12+ 16\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(28\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{
        \(28\neq -4\): The left-hand side does not equal the right-hand side: LHS
        \(\neq\) RHS}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>Due to the fact that this is not a true statement, this demonstrates that
      <m>3</m>is not the solution. However, depending on the complexity of the problem, this "guess and check" method is not very efficient. Thus, we take a more algebraic approach to solving equations. Here we will focus on what are called "one-step equations" or equations that only require one step to solve. While these equations often seem very fundamental, it is important to master the pattern for solving these problems so we can solve more complex problems.

  <subsection>
    <title>Addition Problems</title>
    <p>To solve equations, the general rule is to do the opposite. For example, consider the following:</p>
    <example>
      <title>Solve an Equation Involving Addition</title>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(x +7= -5\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Notice the
        \(7\) is added to the
        \(x\).}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \((x +7)-7= (-5)-7\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Subtract
        \(7\) from both sides to isolate
        \(x\).}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(x = -12\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Our solution
          <assemblage>
            <tt>WeBWorK</tt>answers should include the entire
          \(x = -12\),
            <b>NOT</b>just the value
          \(-12\)
          </assemblage>}
        </mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>Then we get our solution,
      <m>x = -12</m>. The same process is used in each of the following examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Solve Equations Involving Addition</title>

      </md>
    </example>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Subtraction Problems</title>
    <p>In a subtraction problem, we "counteract" negative numbers by adding them to both sides of the equation. For example, consider the following:</p>
    <example>
      <title>Solve an Equation Involving Subtration</title>
      <p></p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(x-5=4\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Notice
        \(5\) is  subtracted from
        \(x\).}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \((x-5)+5=4+5\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Add
        \(5\) to both sides of the equation to solve for
        \(x\).}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(x =9\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Our solution!}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>Then we get our solution
      <m>x =9</m>. The same process is used in each of the following examples. Notice that each time we are "eliminating" a negative number by adding.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Solve Equations Involving Subtraction</title>
      <p></p>
      <md>
        <mrow>-6+x=-2\amp\amp\amp -10=x-7\amp\amp\amp 5=-8+x</mrow>

        <mrow>x=4\amp\amp\amp -3=x\amp\amp\amp 13=x</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Multiplication Problems</title>
    <p>With a multiplication problem, we "eliminate" a constant multiple by multiplying by the reciprocal (or dividing) on both sides. For example consider the following:</p>
    <example>
      <title>Positive Constant Multiple</title>
      <p></p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(4x = 20\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Notice the constant multiple
        \(4\) times the variable
        \(x\).}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(\frac{1}{4}(4x) = \frac{1}{4}\cdot 20\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Multiply both sides by
        \(\frac{1}{4}\)(or divide both sides by
        \(4\)).}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(x = 5\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Our solution!}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>Then we get our solution
      <m>x = 5</m>.
    </p>
    <p>With multiplication problems it is very important that care is taken with signs. If
      <m>x</m>is multiplied by a negative then we will divide by a negative. This is shown in Example 2A-9.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Negative Constant Multiple</title>
      <p></p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(-5x = 30\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{
        \(x\) is multiplied by
        \(-5\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(-\frac{1}{5}(-5x) = -\frac{1}{5}\cdot30\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Multiply both sides by
        \(-\frac{1}{5}\) (or divide both sides by
        \(-5\))}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(x = -6\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Our solution!}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>The same process is used in each of the following examples. Notice how negative and positive numbers are handled as each problem is solved.</p>
    <example>
      <title>Multiply by Reciprocals</title>
      <md>
        <mrow>8x=-24\amp\amp\amp -4x=-20\amp\amp\amp 42=7x</mrow>
        <mrow>\frac{1}{8}(8x)=(-24)\frac{1}{8}\amp\amp\amp \frac{1}{4}(-4x)=(-20)(-\frac{1}{4}) \amp\amp\amp \frac{1}{7}\cdot 42=\frac{1}{7}(7x)</mrow>
        <mrow>x =-3 \amp\amp\amp x=5 \amp\amp\amp 6=x</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Division Problems</title>
    <p>In division problems, "eliminate the denominator" by multiplying on both sides. For example consider:</p>
    <example>
      <title>Eliminate Denominator</title>
      <p></p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(\frac{x}{5}=-3\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Variable
        \(x\) is divided by
        \(5\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{(5)
        \(\frac{x}{5}=-3(5)\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Multiply both sides by
        \(5\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(x = -15\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Our solution!}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>Then we get our solution
      <m>x = -15</m>. The same process is used in each of the following examples.
    </p>
    <example>
      <title>Eliminate Denominator</title>
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{x}{-7}=-2 \amp\amp\amp \frac{x}{8}=5 \amp\amp\amp \frac{x}{-4}=9</mrow>
        <mrow>(-7)\frac{x}{-7}=-2(-7) \amp\amp\amp (8)\frac{x}{8}=5(8) \amp\amp\amp (-4)\frac{x}{-4}=9(-4)</mrow>
        <mrow>x=14\amp\amp\amp x=40 \amp\amp\amp x=-36</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>The process described above is fundamental to solving equations. Once this process is mastered, the problems we will see have several more steps. These problems may seem more complex, but the process and patterns used will remain the same.</p>

    <title>Linear Equations - Two-Step Equations</title>
    <p>After mastering the technique for solving equations that are one-step equations, we are ready to consider two-step equations. As we solve two-step equations, the important thing to remember is that everything works backwards! When working with one-step equations, we learned that in order to clear a "plus five" in the equation, we would subtract five from both sides. We learned that to clear "divided by seven" we multiply by seven on both sides. The same pattern applies to the order of operations. When solving for our variable x, we use order of operations backwards as well. This means we will add or subtract first, then multiply or divide second (then exponents, and finally any parentheses or grouping symbols, but that's another lesson). So to solve the equation in the first example:</p>
    <example>
      <title>Addition then Division</title>
      <p></p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(4x + -20= -8\)}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>We have two numbers on the same side as the variable
      <m>x</m>. We need to handle the
      <m>4</m>and the
      <m>-20</m>. We know to "eliminate" the four we need to divide, and to "eliminate" the subtracted twenty we will add twenty to both sides. If order of operations is done backwards, we add or subtract first. Therefore we will add
      <m>20</m>to both sides first. Once we are done with that, we will divide both sides by
      <m>4</m>. The steps are shown below.
    </p>
    <md>
      <mrow>\text{
        \(4x\color{red}{-20} = -8\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Start by focusing on the subtract
        \(20\)}</mrow>
      <mrow>\text{
        \(\phantom{123456}\underline{+20\,\,+20}\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Add
        \(20\) to both sides}</mrow>
      <mrow>\text{
        \(4x \phantom{1234} = 12\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Now we focus on the
        \(4\) multiplied by
        \(x\)}</mrow>
      <mrow>\text{
        \(\overline{ 4 } \phantom{12345678} \overline{ 4 }\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by
        \(4\)}</mrow>
      <mrow>\text{
        \(x =3\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Our Solution!}</mrow>
    </md>
    <p>One way we can check the correctness of Our Solution is to substitute
      <m>x=3</m>back in to the original equation:
    </p>
    <md>
      <mrow>\text{
        \(4x-20 = -8\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Substitute
        \(x=3\) into the
        <b>LHS</b>}
      </mrow>
      <mrow>\text{
        \(4(3)-20\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Multiply
        \(4(3)\)}</mrow>
      <mrow>\text{
        \(12-20\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Subtract
        \(12-20\)}</mrow>
      <mrow>\text{
        \(-8\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{
        \(-8=-8\): The left-hand side equals the right-hand side:
        <b>LHS=RHS</b>}
      </mrow>
    </md>
    <p>Since we get a true statement
      <m>-8=-8</m>, Our Solution
      <m>x=3</m>is correct.
    </p>
    <p>The same process is used to solve any two-step equations. Add or subtract first, then multiply or divide. Consider our next example and notice how the same process is applied.</p>
    <example>
      <title>Subtraction then Division</title>
      <p></p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(5x\color{red}{+7} = 7\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Start by focusing on the plus
        \(7\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(\underline{-7\phantom{1}-7}\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Subtract
        \(7\) from both sides}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(5x \phantom{123} = 0\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Now we focus on the
        \(5\) multiplied by

        <mrow>\text{
        \(\overline{ 5 } \phantom{1234567} \overline{ 5 }\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by
        \(5\)(recall
        \(\frac{0}{5}=0\))}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(x =0\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Our Solution}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>Notice the seven subtracted out completely! Many students get stuck on this point, do not forget that we have a number for "nothing left" and that number is zero. With this in mind the process is almost identical to our first example.</p>
    <p>A common error students make with two-step equations is with negative signs. Remember the sign always stays with the number. Consider the following example.</p>
    <example>
      <title>Negative Coefficient</title>
      <md>

    <p>The same is true even if there the coefficient in front of the variable is a negative \(1\). Consider the next example.</p>

    <title>Solving Linear Equations-General Equations</title>
    <p>Often as we are solving linear equations we will need to do some work to set them up into a form we are familiar with solving. This section will focus on manipulating an equation we are asked to solve in such a way that we can use our pattern for solving two-step equations to ultimately arrive at the solution.</p>
    <p>One such issue that needs to be addressed is parenthesis. Often the parenthesis can get in the way of solving an otherwise easy problem. As you might expect we can handle the parenthesis by using the distributive property. This is shown in the following example. Notice the first step is distributing, then it is solved like any other two-step equation.</p>
    <example>
      <title>Distribute First</title>
      <p></p>
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(4(2x -6) = 16\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Distribute
        \(4\) through parenthesis: multiply
        \(4(2)\) and
        \(4(-6)\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(8x -24= 16\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Focus on the subtraction first}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+24\,\,\,+ 24}\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Add
        \(24\) to both sides}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(\,\,\,\,\,8x = 40\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Now focus on the multiplication by
        \(8\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(\,\,\,\,\,\overline{\,8\,}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{\,8\,}\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Divide both sides by
        \(8\)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\text{
        \(\,\,\,\,\,x =5\)} \amp\amp\amp \text{Our Solution!}</mrow>
      </md>
    </example>
    <p>Often after we distribute there will be some like terms on one side of the equation. Example
      <xref ref="clear-parentheses" />shows distributing to "clear" the parentheses followed by combining like terms. Notice we only combine like terms on the same side of the equation. Once we have done this, our next example solves just like any other two-step equation.

    <p>A second type of problem that becomes a two-step equation after a bit of work is one where we see the variable on both sides. This is shown in the following example:</p>
    <example>
      <title>Collect Like Terms First</title>

      <md>
        <mrow>\text{

      </md>
      <p>Notice here the
        <m>x</m>is on both the left and right sides of the equation. This can make it difficult to decide which side to work with. We fix this by adding or subtracting one of the terms with
        <m>x</m>to the other side, much like we do with a constant term. It doesn't matter which term gets added or subtracted,
        <m>4x</m>or
        <m>2x</m>, however, it would be our suggestion to subtract the smaller term in this case (to avoid negative coefficients). For this reason we begin this problem by  subtracting
        <m>2x</m>from both sides.

      <m>5</m> have a distance of
      <m>5</m> units from
      <m>0</m> on the number line, both have an absolute value of

      <p>Notice we never combine what is inside the absolute value with what is outside the absolute value. This is very important as it will often change the final result to an incorrect solution. The next example requires two steps to isolate the absolute value. The idea is the same as a two-step equation, add or subtract, then multiply or divide.</p>

        Again we see the same process: isolate the absolute value first, then consider the positive and negative solutions. -->
        <p>
        Often the absolute value will have more than just a variable in it. In this case we will have to solve the resulting equations when we consider the positive and negative possibilities. This is shown in the next example.</p>

        <p>To get the absolute value alone we first need to subtract the
          <m>2</m> from both sides, then divide by
          <m>-4</m>(the coefficient on the absolute value).  Notice we cannot combine the
          <m>2</m> and
          <m>-4</m> because they are not like terms: the
          <m>-4</m> is multiplied by the absolute value expression.  Also notice we do not distribute the
          <m>-4</m> into the absolute value.  This is because the numbers outside cannot be combined with the numbers inside the absolute value. Thus we get the absolute value alone in the following way:
