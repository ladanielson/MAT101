      <p>The complement is useful when you are trying to find the probability of an event that involves the words <em>"at least"</em> or an event that involves the words <em>"at most"</em>. As an example of an at least event is suppose you want to find the probability of making
        <em>
          <term>at least</term> 
        </em>
        <m>\$50,000</m> when you graduate from college. That means you want the probability of your salary being greater than or equal to
        <m>\$50,000</m>. An example of an at most event is suppose you want to find the probability of rolling a die and getting
        <em>
          <term>at most</term> 
        </em>a
        <m>4</m>. That means that you want to get less than or equal to a
        <m>4</m> on the die. The reason to use the complement is that sometimes it is easier to find the probability of the complement and then subtract from
        <m>1</m>.

      <p>Part (a) of <xref ref="example-card-probabilities" autoname="yes" /> demonstrates an
        <term>impossible event</term>: selecting a Jack and an Ace on one draw.  Parts (b) and (c) demonstrate another probability concept.  Notice that:
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>Why does adding two individual probabilities together work in one situation to give the probability of one or another event and not give the correct probability in the other?</p>
      <p>The reason this is true in the case of the Jack and the Ace is that these two events cannot happen together. There is no overlap between the two events, and in fact the
        <m>P(J \cap A) = 0</m>. However, in the case of the Spade and Ace, they can happen together. There is overlap, mainly the ace of spades. The
        <m>P(S \cap A) \neq 0</m>.
      </p>
      <p>When two events cannot happen at the same time, they are called
        <term>mutually exclusive</term>. In the above situation, the events Jack and Ace are mutually exclusive, while the events Spade and Ace are not mutually exclusive.
      </p>

          <li>If two events

          <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive, then

    <title>Conditional Probability</title>
    <p>Suppose you want to figure out if you should buy a new car. When you first go and look, you find two cars that you like the most. In your mind they are equal, and so each has a
      <m>50\%</m> chance that you will pick it. Then you start to look at the reviews of the cars and realize that the first car has had
      <m>40\%</m> of them needing to be repaired in the first year, while the second car only has
      <m>10\%</m> of the cars needing to be repaired in the first year. You could use this information to help you decide which car you want to actually purchase. Both cars no longer have a
      <m>50\%</m> chance of being the car you choose. You could actually calculate the probability you will buy each car, which is a conditional probability. You probably wouldn't do this, but it gives you an example of what a conditional probability is.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Conditional probabilities</term> are probabilities calculated after information is given. This is where you want to find the probability of event
      <m>A</m> happening after you know that event
      <m>B</m> has happened. If you know that
      <m>B</m> has happened, then you don't need to consider the rest of the sample space. You only need the outcomes that make up event
      <m>B</m>. Event
      <m>B</m> becomes the new sample space, which is called the restricted sample space,
      <m>R</m>. If you always write a restricted sample space when doing conditional probabilities and use this as your sample space, you will have no trouble with conditional probabilities. The notation for conditional probabilities is
      <m>P(A, \text{ given } B) = P(A|B)</m>. The event following the vertical line is always the restricted sample space.

      <p>(a) Determine the probability of all

          </md>
          The probability of all
            <m>3</m> calico kittens being boys is
            <m>0.0027\%</m>, which is extremely unlikely.<m>\checkmark</m>

          <p>(b) Determine the probability of
            <term>at least one</term> of the calico kittens being a boy. Recall complementary events help determine probabilities of events involving "at least". Notice there is only one outcome with no male kittens:
            <m>GGG</m>. All of the other outcomes have at least one male kitten.  This means the event <em>"at least one boy"</em> is the complement of the event
            <m>GGG</m>. Use the complement:
            <m>P(\text{at least one boy})=1-P(GGG)</m>. Multiply the probabilities along the path to the outcome
            <m>GGG</m>. 
          <md>
          <mrow>\amp P(GGG)= (0.97)(0.97)(0.97)\approx 0.9127 \amp\amp \text{Now use the complement}
          </mrow>
          <mrow>\amp P(\text{at least one boy})=1-P(GGG)=\amp\amp</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp 1-(0.97)^3\approx 1-0.9127=0.0873 \amp\amp \text{Our Solution (b):}</mrow>
            </md>
            The probability of at least one of the calico kittens being a boy is approximately
            <m>8.73\%\checkmark</m>.
