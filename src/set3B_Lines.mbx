    <title>Slope</title>
    <p>As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify different properties of the lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as 25, is very steep. A line with a small slope, such as
      <m>\frac{1}{10}</m> is very flat. We will also use slope to describe the direction of the line. A line that rises from left to right will have a positive slope and a line that falls from left to right will have a negative slope. A horizontal line will have zero slope. As we measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope as the fraction
      <m>\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the
      <m>y</m>-values. Run would be a horizontal change, or a change in the
      <m>x</m>-values. So another way to describe slope would be the fraction
      <m>\frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}</m>. It turns out that if we have a graph we can draw vertical and horizontal lines from one point to another to make what is called a slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our slope. The following examples show graphs that we find the slope of using this idea.

    <p>As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The second slope can't get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.</p>
    <p>We can find the slope of a line through two points without seeing the points on a graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the change in
      <m>y</m> values, we can calculate this by subtracting the
      <m>y</m> values of a point. Similarly, if run is a change in the
      <m>x</m> values, we can calculate this by subtracting the
      <m>x</m> values of a point. In this way we get the following equation for slope:
    </p>
    <mdn>
      <mrow xml:id="equation-slope">\text{The slope of a line through }
        (x_1, y_1)\text{ and }
        (x_2, y_2)\text{ is }
        \dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
      </mrow>
    </mdn>
    <p>When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope. For this reason we often represent the slope with the variable
      <m>m</m>. Now we have the following for slope:
    </p>
    <mdn>
      <mrow xml:id="equation-m-slope">\text{Slope}
        =m=\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\dfrac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in }x} =\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}</mrow>
      </mdn>
    <p>As we subtract the
      <m>y</m> values and the
      <m>x</m> values when calculating slope it is important we subtract them in the same order. This process is shown in the following examples.

    <title>Slope-Intercept Form</title>
    <p>When graphing a line, one method is to make a table of values. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we may be able to make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is determining the
      <ul>
        <li>slope (represented by
          <m>m</m>) and the
        </li>
        <li>
          <m>y</m>-intercept (represented by
          <m>b</m>)
        </li>
      </ul>of the equation. Recall the
      <m>y</m>-intercept is where the line crosses the vertical axis and that
      <m>x = 0</m> at this point.  Thus the
      <m>y</m>-intercept is the point
      <m>(0, b)</m> on the line where
      <m>b</m> is the value where the graph crosses the vertical
      <m>y</m>-axis. Any other point on the line can be represented by

    <p>We want to be very careful not to confuse using slope to find the next point with using a coordinate such as
      <m>(4, -2)</m> to find an individual point. Coordinates such as
      <m>(4, -2)</m> start from the origin
      <m>(0,0)</m> and move horizontally first, and vertically second. Slope starts from a point on the line that could be anywhere on the graph. The numerator of the slope is the vertical change and the denominator is the horizontal change.
    </p>
    <p>Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very different. Zero slope, corresponding to a horizontal line, will simply have a slope of zero which when multiplied by
      <m>x</m> gives zero in the equation. So the equation simply becomes
      <m>y = b</m> or
      <m>y</m> is equal to the
      <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph. If we have no slope (or undefined slope), or a vertical line, the equation can't be written in slope-intercept form at all because the slope is undefined. There is no
      <m>y</m> in these equations. We will simply make
      <m>x</m> equal to the
      <m>x</m>-intercept of the graph.

            <p>Give the equation of the line in the graph.</p>
            <p>Because we have a horizontal line the slope is zero. Thus the equation has
              <m>y</m> equal to the
              <m>y</m>-intercept of
              <m>2</m>.
